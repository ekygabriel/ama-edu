    text: "I remember joining the early years learning mentorship community last year, with little or no idea about what early years was all about, I kept following every of the free whatsapp discussions and webinars and I personally loved that each of this session took me from the beginner stage to an intermediate stage, I wouldn't want to say advance but at least the stage the class took me gave me a better paying job in a more conducive setting , you needed to see me in my interview talking about the stages of early years and all, I sincerely didn't have to read for the interview because I believed what I got from the training sessions with Mrs Michael-Ayeni were best practices and to think they all came in for freeðŸ¥². I really appreciate Mrs Ayeni and can never forget this in a jiffy.",
