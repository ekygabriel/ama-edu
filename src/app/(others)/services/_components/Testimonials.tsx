    text: "I joined the mentorship community last year, with little or no idea about what early years was all about, I kept following the WhatsApp discussions and webinars and I loved that each of session were enlightening. I was also able to get a better paying job in a more conducive setting. The confidence I had at the interview talking about the stages of development in the early years were all because of the training sessions with Mrs Michael-Ayeni and to think they all came in for freeðŸ¥². I really appreciate Mrs Ayeni and can never forget this in a jiffy. ",

I had the opportunity to witness firsthand her contribution and impact to the education ecosystem when she trained the teaching staff at the academic institution I preside over. Till date, the tools she taught and shared with my team are still very instrumental to curriculum formation and teachers' capacity development at our school.",

    text: "I was glad I signed up for the Teach Your Child to Read phonics course for parents, the course was extremely well-planned with engaging materials and live sessions. What impressed me the most about this course is the engaging session with the tutor, it was also a chance for me to learn phonics too. Iâ€™ve never learned phonics as a child so I benefited from the lessons as well.",
