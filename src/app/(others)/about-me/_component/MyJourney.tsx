          My Teaching Journey:

          <p>
            In January 2013, I embarked on my professional journey as a Year 5
            Class Teacher at a private primary school in Lagos, Nigeria. The
            role presented a unique blend of challenges and exhilaration,
            especially as a new educator. My primary objective was to address
            the diverse learning needs of my students. Despite the limited
            resources provided by the school, I innovatively crafted my own
            teaching materials using charts and recycled products. I also
            offered personalized support to each student, ensuring their
            individual learning requirements were met, while collaboratively
            working with other stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            My commitment to personalized education continued in subsequent
            positions, where I taught Year 1 students. In these roles, I
            initiated after-school programs for students struggling with reading
            and continuously pursued professional development courses. This
            enabled me to deliver high-quality, engaging lessons and cater to
            the needs of both my higher-achieving and struggling students.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January 2017, I joined an International School in Lagos as part
            of a Graduate Teacher Trainee Program. This was my first exposure to
            the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Statutory Framework. The
            program involved hands-on training in classroom management, learner
            engagement and observation, progress tracking, and the creation of
            differentiated learning resources. This experience was
            transformative, igniting my passion for everything related to EYFS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon completing the training in April 2017, I was appointed as a
            Teaching Assistant, initially in a Nursery class for 3-4-year-olds,
            and subsequently for Reception (4-5-year-olds). In August 2018, I
            was promoted to the role of Class Teacher in the Nursery class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, my career has advanced as a Class Teacher and Year Group
            Coordinator in Nursery, and later as a Reception Class Teacher and
            presently a Nursery Manager, within International British settings
            in Lagos. Working in schools affiliated with the Council of British
            International Schools (COBIS) has provided me with numerous
            opportunities for local and international trainings, exposure to
            school inspections by COBIS and ISI/BSO, and preparation for lesson
            observations by senior leaders, all resulting in outstanding
            outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, my school transitioned to
            virtual learning, utilizing platforms like Edmodo, Google Classroom,
            Zoom, and Google Meet. This shift required additional training and
            adaptation, after which I efficiently delivered high-quality online
            lessons. I developed lesson slides, worksheets, and pre-recorded
            lessons using various technological tools.
          </p>
          <p className="relative z-10">
            During this period, I offered my services to several schools and
            parents, providing training and private tutoring to those struggling
            with the demands of virtual learning. This experience led to the
            inception of AMA Educational Services, which evolved into Early
            Years Learning NG. in 2021. My initiative focuses on consulting,
            continuing professional development, mentorship, and providing
            teaching resources, and it has continued to flourish ever since.
